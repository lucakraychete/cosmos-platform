# 🌌 CosmOS

**CosmOS** is a modular, programmable, and community-powered platform for building custom operating systems, desktop-like environments, or digital interfaces — all with drag-and-drop UI design and flexible coding in JavaScript, Node.js, Blueprint logic, or Sudo scripting.

> 🚀 Build your own OS. Share it with the world. Fork the future.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧱 **Modular UI Builder** — Drag, drop, and customize windows, components, and full desktop layouts
- ⚙️ **Multi-Language Logic Engine** — Use JS, Node, Blueprint-style flow, or "Sudo" to power your environment
- 🔌 **Plugin Ecosystem** — Load, share, and develop plugins, apps, logic blocks, and themes
- 🪟 **Cross-Platform Exporting** — Export your custom OS to Electron apps, PWAs, or embed in other platforms
- ☁️ **Template & Plugin Hub (WIP)** — Create a thriving community with a shared marketplace of UI templates, themes, apps, and code snippets
